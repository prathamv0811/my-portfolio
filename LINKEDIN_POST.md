# LinkedIn Post Draft

Here is a "Deep Tech" style LinkedIn post to announce your new portfolio.

**Headline:** Building the Interface for Embodied Intelligence. 🤖✨

I’m excited to share my new personal portfolio—a digital home for my work in **Robotics**, **Deep Tech**, and **Embodied AI**.

As the Founder of **Neural Stride Labs**, I wanted a space that reflects the precision and futurism of the systems we build. This isn't just a resume; it's a window into my research, projects, and the journey of building generalist agents.

**🚀 Key Features:**
*   **Deep Tech Aesthetic**: Glassmorphism, mesh gradients, and a "lab-like" dark mode.
*   **Live Updates**: Integrated directly with my GitHub and LinkedIn for real-time activity.
*   **Research Focus**: A dedicated space for my papers and Medium articles.
*   **Direct Booking**: Seamless calendar integration for collaborations.

Built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion** for a fluid, app-like experience.

I’m always open to connecting with fellow researchers, engineers, and builders in the embodied AI space. Let me know what you think!
